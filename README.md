Data can not be released for this project as it is confidential survey responses from individuals from Ethiopia and Uganda.


In this project, child labor is analyzed in Ethiopia and Uganda from survey data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
The risk of child labor at an individual level and a household level is assessed. 
The most common hazardous and worst forms of child labor in Ethiopia were found to be being exposed to dust and fumes at work, whereas in Uganda, the most common was facing injury, illness, or poor health due to work.
